[{"categories":null,"content":" Hi, I’m Aniket Udaykumar and welcome to my personal blog! I’d love to share my ideas and thoughts here about technology, video games and anything else I find interesting.. Some background about me - I am a software engineer with 3+ years of professional experience I enjoy playing video games (especially Dota2) I love watching sports (NBA, Premier League, Formula 1, MMA,… basically anything! ) I don’t have much planned for this website, but I hope to add some interesting articles about topics I’m currently reading/working on. Not only that, but I also want to add nontechnical posts about video games and other hobbies/interests that I have.
