Hi, I'm Aniket Udaykumar and welcome to my personal blog!

I'd love to share my ideas and thoughts here about technology, video games and anything else I find interesting..

Some background about me - 

 - I am a software engineer with 3+ years of professional experience
 - I enjoy playing video games (especially Dota2)
 - I love watching sports (NBA, Premier League, Formula 1, MMA,... basically anything! )

\
I don't have much planned for this website, but I hope to add some interesting articles about topics I'm currently reading/working on. Not only that, but I also want to add nontechnical posts about video games and other hobbies/interests that I have.
